### **Python Socket Programming** (Python Official Documentation: socket)  
[https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html)

**Purpose**: Creates TCP connections for sending data to the target server.  
**Implementation**: `socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)` creates a TCP socket, `sock.connect((host, port))` connects to the target, and `sock.send(b"\0")` sends data (null byte).

### **Python Threading Module** (Python Official Documentation: threading)  
[https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html)

**Purpose**: Enables concurrent execution of attack threads for simulating high traffic.  
**Implementation**: `threading.Thread(target=attack, args=(host, port, id)).start()` launches a new thread for the attack function.

### **Networking Basics**  
**"Networking Fundamentals" by Microsoft**  
[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/networking-fundamentals/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/networking-fundamentals/)

**Purpose**: Understanding TCP/IP networking concepts (sockets, connections, ports) is essential for building the attack logic.  
**Implementation**: The script simulates client-server communication through TCP connections, sending data to specified IPs and ports.

### **DDoS Attack Understanding**  
**"What is a DDoS Attack?" by Cloudflare**  
[https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/)

**Purpose**: Provides an overview of DDoS attacks, focusing on traffic flooding and how this tool simulates DoS scenarios for testing.  
**Implementation**: The script simulates high traffic to a target server, mimicking the characteristics of a DDoS attack.

### **Python Time Module** (Python Official Documentation: time)  
[https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html)

**Purpose**: Controls execution pace to avoid overwhelming resources.  
**Implementation**: `time.sleep(0.3)` adds a delay between socket operations and thread starts to manage the traffic load and prevent excessive server strain.

### **Error Handling in Python** (Real Python: Python Exception Handling)  
[https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/#handling-exceptions](https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/#handling-exceptions)

**Purpose**: Gracefully handles errors (connection failures, etc.) without crashing the script.  
**Implementation**: `try...except` blocks around socket operations catch and log errors, allowing the script to recover and retry connections.

### **Tkinter - Python GUI Library** (Python Official Documentation: Tkinter)  
[https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)

**Purpose**: Provides the framework for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) of the attack tool.  
**Implementation**: Tkinter is used to create buttons and display real-time network data, such as traffic statistics, attack status, and anomaly/mittigated data.

### **Threaded Programming in Python**  
**Real Python - Multithreading and Multiprocessing**  
[https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/](https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/)

**Purpose**: To run multiple threads for each connection simulation in parallel.  
**Implementation**: The threading module is used to launch and manage attack threads, ensuring that each simulated connection operates independently.

### **Python UDP Traffic Analysis**  
**Python Official Documentation: socket - UDP**  
[https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html)

**Purpose**: Used to create the TrafficAnalyzer class that listens for incoming UDP traffic.  
**Implementation**: The `socket.SOCK_DGRAM` type is used for creating UDP sockets to analyze the incoming traffic on the target system.

### **Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest**  
**scikit-learn Documentation: Isolation Forest**  
[https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest.html](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest.html)

**Purpose**: Implements anomaly detection to identify irregular traffic patterns based on the Isolation Forest algorithm.  
**Implementation**: `IsolationForest()` is used to train a model for identifying anomalies in network traffic, flagging unusual behavior such as DDoS attacks.

### **Pandas - Data Manipulation**  
**Pandas Documentation**  
[https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)

**Purpose**: Handles data manipulation for processing traffic metrics and anomaly detection results.  
**Implementation**: Utilizes Pandas for creating and managing data structures (DataFrames) for storing traffic statistics and anomaly logs.

### **SendGrid API for Email Notifications**  
**SendGrid Documentation**  
[https://sendgrid.com/docs/](https://sendgrid.com/docs/)

**Purpose**: Used for sending email alerts when an anomaly or DDoS attack is detected.  
**Implementation**: SendGrid API is integrated for email functionality using SMTP to notify the user when suspicious traffic is identified.

### **Traffic Monitoring with Wireshark**  
**Wireshark - Network Protocol Analyzer**  
[https://www.wireshark.org/](https://www.wireshark.org/)

**Purpose**: Wireshark provides network packet analysis for more detailed examination of traffic flows and anomalies.  
**Implementation**: Can be integrated to monitor network traffic alongside the custom tool for further traffic analysis.
