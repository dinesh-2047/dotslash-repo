# **Project Progress Report**

## **MOMMYNET**  
**DDoS Attack Protection Mechanism**

## **Progress Overview**
This document outlines the steps undertaken to develop a network traffic analysis tool, integrating a traffic analyzer, anomaly detection mechanisms, and email alert systems. The progress thus far demonstrates a strong foundation for simulating DDoS attacks, detecting anomalies in real-time traffic, and sending alerts upon the detection of high anomaly counts.

## **Current Achievements**

### **1. Research and Conceptualization**
- **Goal**: Understand the concepts of network traffic, anomaly detection, and email notifications in the context of cybersecurity.
- **Outcome**: Developed a solid understanding of how network traffic behaves during DoS/DDoS attacks and how to detect such behavior through anomaly detection methods like Isolation Forest.

### **2. Development of the Attack Simulation**
- **Technologies Used**:  
  - Python (Standard Library: `socket`, `threading`, `time`)
  - Networking concepts (TCP/IP, ports, traffic simulation)
- **Features Implemented**:
  - Developed a multi-threaded simulation to generate high traffic on a target server using TCP connections.
  - Integrated an identity cycling mechanism to mimic traffic from various sources.
  - Implemented error handling to manage failed connections and retries.

### **3. Traffic Analyzer Integration**
- **Goal**: Integrate a traffic analyzer to measure network traffic and detect anomalies in real-time.
- **Technologies Used**:  
  - **Python (Standard Library: `socket`, `threading`)**
  - Traffic analysis through UDP packets, capturing metrics like packet size, connection rate, and bandwidth usage.
- **Features Implemented**:
  - Implemented real-time monitoring for incoming traffic on a specified port.
  - Collected metrics such as total packet count, average packet size, and bandwidth usage.
  - Utilized multithreading to perform non-blocking traffic analysis.

### **4. Anomaly Detection Mechanism**
- **Goal**: Implement an anomaly detection mechanism to identify traffic anomalies using the Isolation Forest algorithm.
- **Technologies Used**:  
  - **scikit-learn** for Isolation Forest modeling.
  - **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **Features Implemented**:
  - Integrated an anomaly detection system using Isolation Forest to flag irregularities in network traffic patterns.
  - The system automatically triggers email alerts when anomalies exceed a set threshold.
  - Log generation for each anomaly detected, including packet count and anomaly details.

### **5. Dashboard Integration**
- **Goal**: Provide a user interface to control the traffic simulation, monitor anomalies, and view network statistics.
- **Technologies Used**:  
  - **Tkinter** for GUI design.
- **Features Implemented**:
  - Created buttons for starting/stopping the attack and for cycling the source identities.
  - Display sections to show anomaly data, mitigated data, and real-time traffic metrics.
  - Integrated real-time updates to display packet counts, average sizes, and anomaly data.

## **Next Steps**

### **1. Implementing DDoS Protection Mechanisms**
- **Objective**: Develop a mechanism to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks in real-time.
- **Planned Technologies**:
  - **Machine Learning**: Leverage more sophisticated algorithms to detect traffic anomalies and patterns in real-time.
  - **Cloud Integration**: Use cloud services like Google Cloud or AWS to implement scalable DDoS protection strategies.
  - **Collaboration with Other Tools**: Explore integration with tools like **Wireshark** or **Suricata** for more comprehensive traffic monitoring.

### **2. Enhancing the Attack Simulation**
- Add support for multiple types of attack payloads (e.g., SYN flood, HTTP request floods).
- Introduce a distributed attack simulation to better mimic real-world DDoS scenarios.
- Improve connection management and error handling during attacks.

### **3. Improving Traffic Analysis and Detection**
- Enhance traffic analysis to support more complex metrics, including protocol analysis and packet inspection.
- Integrate anomaly detection directly into the traffic analysis process, automatically identifying suspicious behaviors such as traffic spikes, SYN floods, or UDP-based attacks.
- Implement a more advanced real-time anomaly detection system that can dynamically adjust based on traffic patterns.

### **4. Enhancing the Dashboard**
- Implement interactive charts and graphs for traffic and anomaly monitoring.
- Allow users to configure alert thresholds and view past traffic data or anomaly trends.
- Improve the user interface to support additional features such as traffic rate analysis and historical anomaly data.

## **Long-Term Vision**
The long-term goal for **MOMMYNET** is to evolve into a comprehensive DDoS attack and mitigation suite that:
1. Simulates various attack scenarios for educational and research purposes.
2. Provides real-time anomaly detection and mitigation capabilities.
3. Incorporates machine learning models to detect sophisticated attack patterns.
4. Offers a user-friendly interface for network administrators to monitor and manage network health.
