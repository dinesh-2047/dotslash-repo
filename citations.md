Python Socket Programming (Python Official Documentation: socket)
https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html

Purpose: Creates TCP connections for sending data to the target server.
Implementation: socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) creates a TCP socket, sock.connect((host, port)) connects to the target, and sock.send(b"\0") sends data (null byte).

###
Python Threading Module (Python Official Documentation: threading)
https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html

Purpose: Enables concurrent execution of attack threads for simulating high traffic.
Implementation: threading.Thread(target=attack, args=(host, port, id)).start() launches a new thread for the attack function.
TCP/IP Networking Concepts (IBM Developer: Introduction to TCP/IP [invalid URL removed])
###
Purpose: Understanding TCP/IP principles (sockets, connections, ports) is vital for building the attack logic.
Implementation: The script establishes TCP connections and sends data to specific IPs and ports, mimicking client-server communication.

###
Python Time Module (Python Official Documentation: time)
https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html
Purpose: Controls execution pace to avoid overwhelming resources.
Implementation: time.sleep(0.3) adds a delay between socket operations and thread starts for stability.

###
Error Handling in Python Real Python: Python Exception Handling
Purpose: Gracefully handles errors (connection failures, etc.) without script crashes.
Implementation: try...except blocks around socket operations catch and log errors, allowing the script to recover and retry.
