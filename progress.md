# **Project Progress Report**

## **MOMMYNET**  
**DDoS Attack Protection Mechanism**

## **Progress Overview**
This document highlights the steps undertaken to develop a network stress-testing script, the integration of a traffic analyzer, and outlines the future roadmap for building a comprehensive DDoS attack protection mechanism.

---

## **Current Achievements**

### **1. Research and Conceptualization**
- **Goal**: Understand the fundamentals of network traffic, socket programming, multithreading in Python, and traffic analysis.
- **Outcome**: Developed a clear understanding of how to simulate traffic using TCP/IP protocols and analyze network traffic.

### **2. Development of the Attack Script**
- **Technologies Used**:  
  - Python (Standard Library: `socket`, `threading`, `time`)
  - Networking concepts (TCP/IP, ports, traffic simulation)
- **Features Implemented**:
  - Multi-threaded network stress-testing script to simulate high traffic on a target server.
  - Dynamic socket creation and error handling for seamless execution.
  - Identity cycling mechanism to mimic traffic from different sources.

### **3. Traffic Analyzer Integration**
- **Goal**: Integrate a traffic analysis component to measure the network traffic in real-time and provide insights into packet flow and connection statistics.
- **Technologies Used**:  
  - **Python (Standard Library: `socket`, `threading`)**
  - Traffic analysis using UDP packets and basic traffic metrics like packet size, connection rate, and bandwidth.
- **Features Implemented**:
  - Real-time traffic monitoring to track incoming packets on a specified port.
  - Calculation of average packet size, total packets received, and bandwidth usage.
  - Threaded implementation for non-blocking network traffic analysis.

### **4. Dashboard Integration**
- **Goal**: Create a user-friendly interface for managing and monitoring the script.
- **Technologies Used**:  
  - **Tkinter** for GUI design.
- **Features Implemented**:
  - Buttons for starting/stopping the attack and cycling identity.
  - Sections to display anomaly and mitigated data.
  - Modular design for easier integration with advanced features.
  - Real-time updates to show traffic analysis data, including total packets and average packet size.

## **Current Limitations**
1. **No Real-Time Data Analysis**:  
   The tool does not yet analyze the impact of the attack on the target server in real time.

2. **No Defensive Mechanism**:  
   The script is limited to simulating attacks and lacks any DDoS protection capabilities.

3. **Static Payload**:  
   The script only sends a null byte (`b"\0"`), limiting its flexibility in testing different types of attacks.

4. **Traffic Analysis Scope**:  
   Currently, the traffic analysis is basic, focusing only on packet counts and average sizes. More advanced traffic pattern analysis is yet to be implemented.

## **Next Steps**

### **1. Implementing a DDoS Protection Mechanism**
- **Objective**: Build a defense mechanism capable of detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks.
- **Planned Technologies**:
  - **Machine Learning**: To analyze traffic patterns and identify anomalies in real-time.
  - **Python Libraries**: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy` for data processing and modeling.
  - **Network Tools**: Integrate with tools like **Wireshark** or **Suricata** for traffic monitoring.
  - **Cloud Integration**: Leverage cloud platforms (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS) for scalable deployment.

### **2. Enhancing the Attack Simulation**
- Add support for multiple payload types to simulate a variety of attack vectors.
- Introduce distributed attack simulation to mimic DDoS scenarios.

### **3. Improving the Traffic Analyzer**
- Enhance the traffic analyzer to support more advanced metrics, such as traffic patterns, protocol analysis, and deeper packet inspection.
- Integrate anomaly detection into the traffic analysis process to automatically identify suspicious behavior.

### **4. Dashboard Upgrades**
- Real-time charts and graphs for monitoring traffic patterns and anomalies.
- Interactive logs to display the state of attacks and defensive actions.

## **Long-Term Vision**
The ultimate goal is to transform this project into a comprehensive **DDoS Attack and Mitigation Suite** that:
1. Simulates attacks for educational and research purposes.
2. Detects and mitigates DDoS attacks in real-time using advanced algorithms.
3. Provides a user-friendly interface for managing network security.
4. Offers real-time traffic analysis to help administrators monitor network health and detect potential attacks.
